# Mask RCNN instance segmentation of groceries
I used Jupyter Notebook to save the output of the cells, in case You want to see it. The notebooks were used in the training and visual evaluation part.  
Training Notebook is [maskrcnn_groceries.ipynb](https://github.com/macodroid/maskrcnn-groceries/blob/main/maskrcnn_groceries.ipynb)  
Evaluation Notebook is [eval_maskrcnn.ipynb](https://github.com/macodroid/maskrcnn-groceries/blob/main/eval_maskrcnn.ipynb)
